# Blog

This is my personal/development blog. This is where I dump all of my ideas. You can read it [here](https://mhanberry1.github.io/blog).

# Usage

* All posts are written using markdown, and then compiled to html.
* The posts are written as `posts/*.md` files.
* The html files are built using `./build.sh`
