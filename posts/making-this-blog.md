# making this blog

I'm a developer who likes to keep to himself, so stepping out of my comfort zone to create a blog like this was many years in the making. You see, I'm the type of guy who has a ton of ideas, and I inevitably forget about them if I don't get them down on paper before they fade away. I've tried many different ways to organize my thoughts -- I've probably been through every note-taking app in existence. But when it comes time to share these ideas with others, it's always an awkward process where I have to copy it to a different format, then send it to them somehow. I think a blog will let me skip those extra steps, and I'll be able to say "here's a link" instead.

If you'd like to continue reading more posts by me, here's a fair warning: I've never considered myself to be much of a writer. Plus, this is just going to be a place where I can dump my ideas and move on. I'll barely proofread (if at all), so if you see something that really needs to be changed, you can make a pull request on the [github repo](https://github.com/mhanberry1/blog). But be warned, only a freak would create a pull request to update someone else's blog. Are you a freak? Yes? Okay, have fun.
